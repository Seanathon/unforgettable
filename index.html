                                    Nam is also working on a variety of additional projects including: a supporting role in the indie feature “Puberty” for Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder Films opposite Abbie Cornish a supporting role in the new Netflix original film “Happy Anniversary” (written and directed by Jared Stern) and a guest star role on the new Comedy Central series “Hampton DeVille.”

                                    Born in Argentina to Korean immigrant parents and raised in Sydney, Australia, Nam attended Sydney Technical High School and studied architecture at the University of New South Wales. To pursue his dream of becoming an actor, Leonardo moved to New York at 19. There he studied drama at the critically acclaimed HB Studio and also worked with the New York Public Theater/Shakespeare in the Park company and Sigourney Weaver and Jim Simpson’s The Bats Theater Company. His breakout role came in the Paramount comedy “The Perfect Score,” starring Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans and Erika Christensen. Since then he has starred in a string of movies, namely “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” 1 &amp; 2, “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,” “Vantage Point,” “He’s Just Not That Into You,” “One for the Money,” and most recently in the Sam Raimi production “Murder of a Cat.”

                                    Filmmaker and actor, Justin Chon richly deserved the major attention he enjoyed at this year’s Sundance Film Festival for his film “Gook,” taking home the Next Audience Award. Set during the 1992 L.A. Riots, the film centers on the relationship between an African American girl and two Korean brothers who own a shoe store in Paramount, California. The film was inspired by events from Chon’s own childhood. He was born in South Korea and grew up in California’s Bay Area, where he helped out at his parents’ beauty supply store. In August 2017, the limited national release of “Gook” opened to widespread critical acclaim and a positive public reception.

                                    Ross Butler is emerging as a prominent player in Hollywood’s next generation. Variety Magazine named him one of 10 TV Stars to Watch in 2017. Butler currently portrays the popular basketball jock, Zach Dempsey in the binge-worthy Netflix series, “13 Reasons Why”. This high school drama-mystery has become one of the most watched shows of all time for the live streaming conglomerate and became the most tweeted show of 2017. Butler’s dedication to his craft and urge to break free from typecasting has earned him extraordinary praise and created a much bigger conversation about Asian Americans in diversity.

                                    Butler first began his acting career in 2010, when he left his path toward chemical engineering at Ohio State University for a life in front of the camera. He made his acting debut opposite, Zendaya, on Disney Channel’s “K.C. Undercover,” and the Disney’s smash hit “Teen Beach 2,” MTV’s most watched series and cult classic, “Teen Wolf,” and most recently as Reggie Mantle in The CW’s critically acclaimed series, “Riverdale.”

Last spring, she was added to the cast of "Crazy Rich Asians" as the part of Peik Lin.

                                    Nam is also working on a variety of additional projects including: a supporting role in the indie feature “Puberty” for Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder Films opposite Abbie Cornish a supporting role in the new Netflix original film “Happy Anniversary” (written and directed by Jared Stern) and a guest star role on the new Comedy Central series “Hampton DeVille.”
